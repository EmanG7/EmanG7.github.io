<p>Going to college can teach you alot especially if your degree is cybersecurity. 
But nowadays, around the time of this posting, everyone has a degree in the ever evolving field of cybersecurity or computer science.
I needed a start to prove to myself and others that I knew what I’m doing in tech that was more than just my degree. 
I realized certifications are the next best thing compared to a degree if getting a job in the field is too difficult. 
Surely this will give me the advantage in the job market. Right?
Searching around through the hundreds if not thousands cybersecurity certifications, I set my sight on CompTIA’s Security+ ce.</p>

<h2 id="getting-serious">Getting Serious</h2>
<p>By the time I started preparing for Security+, there was two versions of the exam, SY0-601 and SY0-701. 
The 601 version is more conceptual and has more standards or compliance and the 701 version is more practical and updated for current trends.
I went with the 701 version because of two items: its practical nature and the new addition of involving cloud and automation.</p>

<p>Security+ has two type of questions: mutliple-choice and performance-based. 
Multiple-choice is exactly what you expect, a question with four possible answers like definitions or acronyms.
Studying flashcards and doing practice tests is what I did to refresh myself on information I needed for the exam.
Performance-based, or PBQ for short, is more like a diagram or situation type of question, where you fill in missing parts of a diagram or solve what is happening in explained situation.
Studying for PBQs were a bit more difficult to do.
It could be a firewall exercise, matching situations to attacks, or even reading logs.
I won’t be getting any more specific than this.</p>

<p>My form of studying for PBQs was to make them practical by deploying firewalls, reading web log files, and getting a deeper understanding of attacks by performing them myself on virtual machines.
This led to me starting a half-baked homelab network for cybersecurity purposes instead of running a bunch of individual virtual machines.
Whenever studying for more practical questions, I recommended practical methods and solutions to gave the experience of actually doing the task.</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>Some examples of practical solutions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Deploy a pfSense firewall into a virtual environment between other virtual machines and the internet then change the firewall rules to block certain traffic and allow other.</li>
    <li>Deploy some beginner <strong>Vulhub</strong> virtual machines and read through guides on how to attack them.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Once enough studying was done, I set my exam date to be soon after, like a week. 
I already did all my preparation and studying beforehand but if you set it up before preparing, it is a great motivator. 
I didn’t want to forget common items but I knew I’d waste my time studying those instead of more difficult questions.
Therefore, all my studies for that week was mostly things I wasn’t the most confident on.</p>

<h2 id="e-day">E-Day</h2>
<p>January 9th, 2024 aka Exam day, was proctored at a Pearson VUE testing center. 
With the exam only being 90 minutes long and having up to a maximum of 90 questions, I went in aiming for the PBQs first as they could take the longest.
Luckily, I only had a few PBQs and was able to move onto the multiple-choice questions quickly.
Remember being able to skip questions, allows other questions to be answered swiftly and makes more time avaliable to the skipped or more difficult questions presented.</p>

<p>Nearing the end of the exam, I double even triple checked to see I still wasn’t unsure about a question or not and finally submitted.
Even for a entry level certification, the pressure is still there.
So when I saw “PASS” on my screen, I was relieved.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Security+ by itself doesn’t give a large advantage in the current job market as it’s rated to be an entry level certification.
But in the end, I’m glad I did it because it’s just the start.
Just have to keep on moving, gaining from every step you take.
A little bit every day adds up to more than staying same.</p>]]></content><author><name>Elijah Iverson</name></author><category term="blogs" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Getting a grip by working towards the first of many certifications, CompTIA Security+]]></summary></entry></feed>
