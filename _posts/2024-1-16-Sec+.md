## CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701)
I bet if you found this blog, you already have an idea of what Security+ is. To keep it short, I'll say it's a security vendor-neutral certification from [CompTIA](https://comptia.org).

In my point of view and even many others within the field see Security+ as a standard for entry level positions. It can be difficult for some and not for others but a steady study habit, I think anyone could pass this exam. Even if you fail, you can just take a step back and review the domains you need more work on and keep everything else fresh in your mind as well.

### Was it Hard?
I stressed myself over this because I was scared of failing. In the end, just a quarter of the way through my exam, I felt relief as I thought I was overprepared and didn't have to overthink simple questions. Side note too, I'm a college graduate with a degree in Cybersecurity therefore I had four years of education experience before taking this certification.

The exam is a max of 90 questions, mixed of multiple choice and performanced based questions. But that doesn't mean you'll get 90 questions, it just means you could. Less questions usually means questions are worth more points and less chance to lose out on points by getting more questions wrong from having more questions.

When comparing SY0-601 to SY0-701. All the studying material I found was basically the same with just a slight change in focus. The SY0-601 has more compliance, practical specifics, and older technologies as the SY0-701 has more emerging technologies like cloud, automation, and new risk, vulnerabilities and strategy standards as the world of cyber continues to develop. I guess you easily assume newer exams have new content on them as well compared to the past as the new content didn't exist or wasn't acknowledged yet back then.

## What's next for me?
After getting Security+ way later than I should have, I'm continuing my studyings for Cloud and Security certifications like AWS Solution Architect and Cloud+ then on to CySA+ and CASP+. This is the current plan and it could change in the future.
