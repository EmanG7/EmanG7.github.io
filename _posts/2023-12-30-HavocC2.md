## Why Havoc C2
Havoc C2 is the first part to a larger project currently in the works to learn more about red teaming. Recently, an opporunity has arisen to support my college's CCDC team and get hands-on experience being on the other side, the red team side. I'm doing this in cooperation with other alumni from the team. These next few blogs are about exploring tools and tactics that I will utilizing to simulate the competition to certain extend for them to practice against.

We're using Havoc as a C2 Teamserver for post exploitation, which is considered an alternative to Cobalt Strike. Cobalt Strike is something I've personally dealt with before during competition. Havoc can utilize HTTP and HTTPS protocols to communicate between exploited machines and the C2 server.

## Installing Havoc on Kali

Installing Kali Dependencies for Havoc.
```bash
sudo apt install -y git build-essential apt-utils cmake libfontconfig1 libglu1-mesa-dev libgtest-dev libspdlog-dev libboost-all-dev libncurses5-dev libgdbm-dev libssl-dev libreadline-dev libffi-dev libsqlite3-dev libbz2-dev mesa-common-dev qtbase5-dev qtchooser qt5-qmake qtbase5-dev-tools libqt5websockets5 libqt5websockets5-dev qtdeclarative5-dev golang-go qtbase5-dev libqt5websockets5-dev python3-dev libboost-all-dev mingw-w64 nasm  
```

Cloning Havoc source code from github to "/opt" directory.
```bash
cd /opt && git clone https://github.com/HavocFramework/Havoc.git
```

Adding Go dependencies to "/opt/Havoc/teamserver" directory and back stepping to "/opt/Havoc" directory.
```bash
cd /opt/Havoc/teamserver
go mod download golang.org/x/sys
go mod download github.com/ugorji/go
cd ..
```

Using make to build teamserver.
```bash
make ts-build

# Runs teamserver binary from make with default profile
./havoc server --profile ./profile/havoc.yaotl
```

Again, using make to build client.
```bash
make client-build

# Runs client binary from make
./havoc client
```

For other distro installation or methods, visit the [Official Havoc Documenation](https://havocframework.com/docs/installation).

## Unleashing a Demon
### Connecting to the teamserver
After running both the teamserver and client command, `./havoc server --profile profile/havoc.yaotl && ./havoc client` in the Havoc folder, the following interface in the image below appears allowing the user to login. All defaults credentials and information for this can be found within "profile/havoc.yaotl" Which can be edited.

### Creating the Listener
Before creating the demon agent, we need to create a listener for the demon agent to connect to. Click the "View" tab along with the "Listener" button within to open a listener table in the interface.

![Using the "View" tab at the top to open the listener window](/assets/images/blog-images/havoc2/HavocListenerView.png)

Using the Listener table that just opened from the steps before, Click the "Add" button to create a new listener.

The new listener will appear within the table and can be edited with the "edit" button below.

### Formulating the Payload
Now that there's a listener that the demon agent can use, lets start making the payload. Click the "Attack" tab along with the "Payload" button to open the payload window.

![Using the "Attack" tab at the top to create a new payload](/assets/images/blog-images/havoc2/HavocPayloadView.png)

From the new payload window, ensure that the agent is a demon, listener is the name of the listener that was created before, and that the format is Windows Shellcode. Finally click "Generate" at the bottom of the window.

Once it's done generating, it'll prompt to save to a folder location and name the payload. 

### The Biggest Issue and Resolution
There were issues, specifically this one issue I had while uploading it onto my Windows 11 VM, Windows Defender was detecting it. When I tested this the first time, Windows Defender didn't catch it but trying it again, it was caught. Therefore to fix this...

The Shellcode needs to be encrypted, which is when I used a XOR to do so that way I can encrypt and decrypt it easily with minimal lines of code in python.
```python
key = 59 # example key uses low prime number.
results = bytearray([b ^ key for b in bytearray(data)])
```

Transfer the encrypted payload over to Windows 11, there's many ways of doing so. From there, I made an executable that executed a decryption process of using the exact same XOR function and...

### Executing the Payload
...launch the decrypted shellcode payload.

After executing the payload on the victims machine, click the "View" tab again and hover over session view and click "Graph" for an image representation of the Demon agent connection to the C2 teamserver.

## Results
Rough landing but once everything was set up and in place, I could control see all the processes and files of the Windows 11 VM from the Havoc C2 Teamserver. 

I'm sorry if this looks like a mess of a tutoral. This is just my steps of how I did and what I've been learning about for a general understanding of how red teaming is like at different stages of offensive framework.
